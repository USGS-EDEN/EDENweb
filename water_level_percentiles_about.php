<h3>Daily Water-Level Percentiles by Month &ndash; About Water-Level Data</h3>
<p>To account for the varying quality of review by the operating agencies, water-level data at gages are identified in one of three ways; real-time, provisional, or final. Users should consider the quality of the &lsquo;recent daily water level&rsquo; on the plots showing daily water-level percentiles by month. <strong>Real-time water-level data</strong> for the gages are relayed daily by satellite or other telemetry and have received little or no review from the operating agency. The EDEN team uses the ADAM software to quality-assure real-time data and estimate missing data. Subsequent reviews and edits of the data may result in substantial revisions to the data. <strong>Provisional water-level data</strong> for the gages are provided on a quarterly basis from the operating agencies and have received some review and edits by them. For some agencies, the review is near final while for others, the review is preliminary. The EDEN team uses the ADAM software to further quality-assure the provisional data and estimate missing data. Then, the provisional data overwrites the previous real-time data in the EDEN database. <strong>Final water-level data</strong> for the gages is provided on an annual basis from the operating agencies. The ADAM software is used to verify the final data and estimate missing data. Occasionally, the EDEN team modifies final data from the operating agency when ADAM indicates significant differences. Then the final data overwrites the previous provisional data in the EDEN database.</p>
