<h3><abbr title="one">I</abbr>. Major Accomplishments</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="../models/watersurfacemod_download.php">Real-time, provisional, and final EDEN surfaces</a></strong> are being produced and posted to EDENweb on schedule. Surfaces currently posted on the EDENweb include:
    <ul>
      <li>Provisional for 10/1/2012 through 6/30/2013</li>
      <li>Real-time for 7/1/2013 through current</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>With the support of <abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey">USGS</abbr> <abbr title="Greater Everglades Priority Ecosystems Science">Greater Everglades Priority Ecosystem Science (GE PES)</abbr> funds, maintained <strong>operation of 19 of the original 25 EDEN-funded gages and 2 coastal water-level gages</strong> (originally established for <a href="https://archive.usgs.gov/archive/sites/sofia.usgs.gov/projects/index.php?project_url=dyn_margin">Tom Smith's <abbr title="surface elevation table">SET</abbr> project</a>). Starting 10/1/12, 6 water-level gages funded by EDEN had to be discontinued because <abbr title="REstoration COordination and VERification">RECOVER</abbr> funding was cut by 30% in <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2012">FY12</abbr>.
    <ul>
      <li>Four gages operated by <abbr title="South Florida Water Management District">SFWMD</abbr> and used by the EDEN surface-water model were discontinued in <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2013">FY13</abbr>.</li>

<h3><abbr title="two">II</abbr>. Support from other Programs and Funding Sources</h3>
<p><em>Greater Everglades <abbr title="Priority Ecosystems Science">PES</abbr> funds</em> continue to support the
EDEN project by funding efforts by Paul Conrads (<abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey, South Carolina">USGS-SC</abbr>), Heather Henkel (<abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey, Saint Petersburg">USGS-St. Pete</abbr>), Bryan McCloskey (<abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey, Saint Petersburg">USGS-St. Pete</abbr>), and Matt Petkewich (<abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey, South Carolina">USGS-SC</abbr>). Additionally, <abbr title="Greater Everglades Priority Ecosystems Science">GE PES</abbr> provides some funds for Pamela Telis (<abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey">USGS</abbr>-Jacksonville) in
her role as project coordinator and liaison with the <abbr title="U.S. Army Corps of Engineers">USACE</abbr>. The following major accomplishments were completed with <abbr title="Greater Everglades Priority Ecosystems Science">GE PES</abbr> funds:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../coastal.php"><strong>Coastal EDEN</strong> webpages</a> completed and posted to EDENweb, data provided includes:
    <ul>
      <li>Three parameters for 24 coastal gages

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a href="../nexrad.php">Rainfall</a> and <abbr title="evapotranspiration"><a href="../evapotrans.php">evapotranspiration (ET)</a></abbr></strong><a href="../evapotrans.php"> data</a> continue to be updated regularly for the EDEN gage network and posted to the EDENweb.

  <li><strong>EDEN-Syn</strong> was developed and tested by users using the prototype application developed in <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2012">FY12</abbr>. EDEN-Syn generates synthetic hydrographs for <abbr title="Water Conservation Area 3A">WCA3A</abbr> South thereby allowing users to create hypothetical hydrologic datasets for use in ecological models.</li>
  <li>Initiated development and testing of <strong>subarea models </strong>for water-level surfacing; may be used to improve daily surfaces and allow for more efficient testing of scenarios by users.</li>
  <li>In coordination with the <abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey Center for Integrated Data Analytics">USGS Center for Integrated Data Analytics (CIDA)</abbr> began development of a graphical interface to allow access to the EDEN database replacing the less versatile <abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey">USGS</abbr> NWISweb. Design of <strong><abbr title="Explore and View EDEN">Explore and View EDEN (EVE)</abbr> Version 1</strong> is complete and programming has begun.</li>
  <li>Revised two <strong>EDENapps</strong> tools to provide better user experience and to work with 64-bit machines
    <ul>
      <li><a href="../edenapps/dataviewer.php">DataViewer</a> (V2.0.2) was based on the EverVIEW Data Viewer used for viewing model data</li>
      <li><a href="../edenapps/transectplotter.php">TransectPlotter</a> (V1.2) was recompiled for 64-bit machines</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Developed <strong>THREDDS Server</strong> to provide easier access to EDEN datasets. Test version shares space with another server in <abbr title="Saint Petersburg">St. Pete</abbr> <abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey">USGS</abbr> office. After testing will be migrated to production server.</li>
  <li>Published one and drafted four reports that document aspects of the EDEN project:

<h3><abbr title="seven">VII</abbr>. Anticipated Needs and Issues</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Several <abbr title="U.S. Army Corps of Engineers">USACE</abbr>-funded water-level gages have not had elevation surveys in several decades. These gages are significant gages used by the EDEN surface-water model and used by scientists and managers for managing water resources in the Everglades. It is important that funding be made available to have updated surveys conducted at these gages to ensure the best possible datasets used by EDEN and others.</li>
</ul>
<a id="sxn8"></a>
<h3><abbr title="eight">VIII</abbr>. Funding Status</h3>
<ul>
  <li>As of 9/30/13, all of the <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2012">FY12</abbr> funding under <abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey">USGS</abbr> IA #28 has been expended or obligated. Invoices will be electronically submitted to the <abbr title="U.S. Army Corps of Engineers">USACE</abbr> within the next few months.</li>
  <li><abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey">USGS</abbr> <abbr title="Priority Ecosystems Science">Priority Ecosystem Science (PES)</abbr> funding in <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2013">FY13</abbr> was to multiple principal investigators in support for EDEN research efforts. This level of support is expected to be continued in <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2014">FY14</abbr> with a potential 5-10% cut.</li>
