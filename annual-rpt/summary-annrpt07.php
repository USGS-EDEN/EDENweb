<h4><abbr title="one">I</abbr>. Major Accomplishments</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The EDENweb (<a href="../index.php">sofia.usgs.gov/eden</a>) site was made publicly accessible in November 2006 and email announcements went to all RECOVER team members, <abbr title="RECOVER Leadership Group">RLG</abbr>, and others with potential interest.</li>
  <li>The January 2007 version of the ground surface <abbr title="Digital Elevation Model">DEM</abbr> was posted to EDENweb and documented in a report recently posted on EDENweb.</li>
  <li>Paul Conrads hindcasted data for 25 of the new EDEN gages (having no data before early 2006) using artificial neural network prediction models. The results have very high R-square values and made significant improvements in the daily water surface model results.</li>
  <li>In March, provisional EDEN data (specifically, daily water surfaces) were provided to all the <abbr title="Greater Everglades">GE</abbr> Wetlands Module <abbr title="Principal Investigators">PIs</abbr> and several others (total of about 35) for use in their assessments for 2007 SSR.</li>
  <li>Throughout the second half of the year, the water surfacing program was &quot;tweaked&quot;, improved, tested, and enhanced to better serve the users. As with any model, further refinements are always possible.</li>
  <li>Ground elevation was collected at nearly all EDEN gages and posted to the EDENweb for users and plotted on the gage hydrographs. This provides users with a quick assessment of &quot;dry&quot; conditions in the vicinity of their study sites.</li>
  <li>EDENapps was reprogrammed as a series of utilities that will offer easier analysis and manipulation of data by users. Also, EDENapps was reprogrammed to read <abbr title="net C D F">netCDF</abbr> daily maps files.</li>
  <li>The EDEN surface water model was modified to create daily map layers in <abbr title="net C D F">netCDF</abbr> format. This format replaces the bulky file structure and difficult file management of the ESRI grids. This allows EDEN applications to run on computers without <abbr title="Arc G I S">ArcGIS</abbr> installations.</li>
  <li><abbr title="University of Florida">UF</abbr> compiled input datasets for running the <abbr title="Tides and Inflows in the Mangrove Ecotone">TIME</abbr> model for the period 2002 to 2006 with funding provided by <abbr title="South Florida Water Management District">SFWMD</abbr> directly to <abbr title="University of Florida">UF</abbr>. These data will be reviewed by <abbr title="United States Geological Survey">USGS</abbr> and posted on the EDENweb in <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2008">FY08</abbr>.</li>
  <li>To provide users with &quot;confidence&quot; in the daily surface water maps, an analysis of field-measured data by John Volin (<abbr title="Florida International University">FIU</abbr>, now University of <abbr title="Connecticut">CT</abbr>) and staff was conducted with daily maps from EDEN. Statistical results of this analysis offers users a measure of the &quot;confidence&quot; of EDEN results and documentation is forthcoming in <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2008">FY08</abbr>.</li>
  <li>EDEN staff have met with many <abbr title="Principal Investigators">PIs</abbr> and others involved with restoration to seek collaborations, inform them of EDEN data, and gain input for EDEN direction:
    <ul>
      <li>University researchers - Ross, Volin, Trexler, Gawlik, Fitz, Owen, Brandt, Doran, Nonberg</li>
      <li><abbr title="South Florida Water Management District">SFWMD</abbr> staff - S. Newman, Sklar, Obeysekera, McVoy, Rutchey</li>
      <li><abbr title="United States Geological Survey">USGS</abbr> researchers - Rice, Kitchens</li>
      <li><abbr title="Everglades National Park">ENP</abbr> researcher - Engel</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><abbr title="two">II</abbr>. Significant Meetings/Workshops</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>EDEN/JEM lab workshops were conducted at 3 locations in January-February 2007; <abbr title="South Florida Water Management District">SFWMD</abbr>, <abbr title="United States Fish and Wildlife Service">USFWS</abbr>, and <abbr title="Everglades National Park">ENP</abbr>. Approximately 60 people attended and we had an opportunity to introduce EDEN to many and talk with many already familiar with EDEN. Future workshops need to be focused to target groups and their needs for data access and manipulation. Most of the comments about the usefulness and relevance of the EDEN were extremely positive.</li>
  <li>The EDEN team met with Ken Rutchey (<abbr title="South Florida Water Management District">SFWMD</abbr>) and the <abbr title="Water Management District">WMD</abbr> drought monitoring team who are using the EDENweb real-time data to monitoring drought conditions. We discussed the problem of gages &quot;going dry&quot; and knowing if the gage is truly recording water levels below ground surface in the vicinity of the gage. The <abbr title="Water Management District">WMD</abbr> will prepare a cost estimate for adding shallow wells to several drought &quot;index&quot; gages. These data would be readily available on EDENweb.</li>
  <li>The EDEN model and tools were presented by Leonard Pearlstine at the Second National Conference on Ecosystem Restoration in April 2007 in Kansas City, <abbr title="Missouri">MO</abbr>.</li>
  <li>An overview of EDEN was presented as part of the <abbr title="United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization">UNESCO</abbr> <abbr title="Institute for Water Education">IHE</abbr> Modeling Course on June 6, 2007 in West Palm Beach, <abbr title="Florida">FL</abbr>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><abbr title="three">III</abbr>. Administrative</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>In April 2007, the extension for the EDEN project from 4/1/07 to 3/31/10 was approved and funding through 9/30/07 was received.</li>
  <li>The EDEN project continued to fund <abbr title="University of Florida">UF</abbr> for project support through a <abbr title="Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Unit">CESU</abbr> agreement in <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2007">FY07</abbr> and plans to fund in <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2008">FY08</abbr>. The <abbr title="University of Florida">UF</abbr> lead is Leonard Pearlstine who resigned his position on 9/7/07 at <abbr title="University of Florida">UF</abbr> and is now a staff biologist for <abbr title="Everglades National Park">ENP</abbr>, Homestead.</li>
  <li>Greater Everglades <abbr title="Priority Ecosystems Science">PES</abbr> funds continue to support the EDEN project by funding efforts by Paul Conrads (<abbr title="United States Geological Survey">USGS</abbr>-<abbr title="South Carolina">SC</abbr>), John Jones (<abbr title="United States Geological Survey">USGS</abbr>-Reston), Heather Henkel (<abbr title="United States Geological Survey">USGS</abbr>-<abbr title="Florida">FL</abbr>), and Aaron Higer (<abbr title="University of Florida">UF</abbr>). Additionally, <abbr title="Priority Ecosystems Science">PES</abbr> provides some funds for Pamela Telis (<abbr title="United States Geological Survey">USGS</abbr>-<abbr title="Florida">FL</abbr>) in her role as project coordinator and liaison with the <abbr title="United States Army Corps of Engineers">USACE</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Approximately 3 days of helicopter support from the <abbr title="South Florida Water Management District">SFWMD</abbr> allowed for collection of critical ground elevation data at remote gages at no cost to the EDEN project. Thanks to Patty Goodman.</li>
