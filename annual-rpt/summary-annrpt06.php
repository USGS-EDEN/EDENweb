<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>The Everglades Depth Estimation Network (EDEN) is an integrated network of real-time water-level monitoring, ground-elevation modeling, and water-surface modeling that provides scientists and managers with current (1999-present), on-line water-depth information for the entire freshwater portion of the greater Everglades. Presented on a 400-square-meter grid spacing, EDEN offers a consistent and documented dataset that can be used by scientists and managers, to: (1) guide large-scale field operations, (2) integrate hydrologic and ecological responses, and (3) support biological and ecological assessments that measure ecosystem responses to the implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1999). The target users are biologists and ecologists examining trophic level responses to hydrodynamic changes in the Everglades.</p>
<p>The RECOVER Monitoring and Assessment Plan (MAP) project entitled &quot;South Florida Surface Water Hydrologic Network for Support of MAP Projects&quot; and now referred to simply as EDEN was initiated on March 28, 2005 to support hypotheses in the MAP section 3.5, South Florida Hydrology Monitoring Network Module and MAP Section 3.1, Greater Everglades Wetlands Module.</p>
<h4>Purpose and Organization of Annual Report</h4>
<p>The purpose of the annual progress report is to document work and products completed in <abbr title="Fiscal Year 06">FY06</abbr>. Many of the products completed in FY06 were a culmination of work effort from the project start in <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2004">FY2004</abbr>.</p>
<p>Each section of the report begins with a section summary page (presented in the summary version without the complete section text and figures) which provides an overview of what was completed by project component. Potential future direction is documented in a brief discussion under Future Work Considerations. Since this is a summary of the <abbr title="Fiscal Year 06">FY06</abbr> Annual Progress Report, only a list of the contents of each section is provided.</p>
<p>Because EDEN has many component pieces, two flow diagrams show the relationships,  data flow, and feedback among the project components (see diagrams attached). These diagrams at various levels of complexity offer the reader a less detailed or more detailed understanding of these interconnections. On the EDEN project diagram, the report sections are identified by a letter A through G, which corresponds to sections of the report.</p>
