<h3><abbr title="one">I</abbr>. Major Accomplishments</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="../models/watersurfacemod_download.php">Real-time, provisional, and final EDEN surfaces</a></strong> are being produced and posted to EDENweb on schedule. Surfaces currently posted on the EDENweb include:
    <ul>
      <li>Final for 1/1/2000 through 9/30/2011</li>
      <li>Provisional for 10/1/2011 through 6/30/2012</li>
      <li>Provisional for 1/1/1991 through 12/31/1999</li>
      <li>Real-time for 7/1/2012 through current</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Converted processing of real-time EDEN daily water-level surfacing using <strong><abbr title="version 2">V2</abbr> surface-water model</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Includes automated use of <strong><abbr title="Automated Data Assurance and Management">ADAM</abbr> software</strong> for screening bad or missing data and for filling data gaps with estimates using nearby gage data</li>
      <li>Includes newly formatted daily median files that tell users whether data for each gage is measured, estimated, missing, or dry.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>With the support of <abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey">USGS</abbr> <abbr title="Greater Everglades Priority Ecosystem Science">Greater Everglades Priority Ecosystem Science (GE PES)</abbr> funds, maintained <strong>operation of all 25 EDEN-funded gages and 9 coastal water-level gages</strong> originally established for Tom Smith's <abbr title="Sediment Elevation Table">SET</abbr> project. <abbr title="Greater Everglades Priority Ecosystems Science">GE PES</abbr> funds filled the funding gap when the EDEN budget was cut by 30% this <abbr title="Fiscal Year">FY</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Generated EDEN daily water-level surfaces for 1/1/91 through 12/31/99 using <a href="../hindcasted.php">hindcasted datasets</a> completed in <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2011">FY11</abbr>.
    <ul>
      <li>Due to extreme low-water conditions in 1990, datasets need more analysis prior to surfacing.</li>
      <li>Users are cautioned about the quality of the water-level surfaces in the vicinity of several gages where data is not consistent with previous datasets.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>confidence index</strong> by Pearlstine and others (2007) was tested using the newly revised <abbr title="version 2">V2</abbr> modeled surfaces. None of the parameters, such as distance from a gage, were strongly correlated with water-level differences measured at the <a href="../benchmarks/">benchmark network</a>. Although a confidence index map would provide users with a general guideline about the accuracy of water levels modeled by EDEN, the parameters that define the areas with lower confidence are not yet clear.</li>
  <li>A <strong>network analysis</strong> was conducted in <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2012">FY12</abbr> to evaluate whether selected water-level gages could be removed with limited impact to the EDEN daily water-level surfaces. This analysis was necessitated because the EDEN budget was cut by 30% in <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2012">FY12</abbr> and expected at this level in <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2013">FY13</abbr> and beyond. Because the EDEN surface-water model interpolates between water levels at gages, the confidence of the surfaces depends on the location, distribution, and accuracy of the gage network. The EDEN network analysis was coordinated with the <abbr title="South Florida Water Management District">SFWMD</abbr> which conducted an agency network analysis for the purpose of reducing their monitoring budget for <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2013">FY13</abbr>.
    <ul>
      <li>On 9/6, the EDEN project provided <abbr title="South Florida Water Management District">SFWMD</abbr> and <abbr title="U.S. Army Corps of Engineers">USACE</abbr> with final recommendations for gages that can be discontinued by <abbr title="South Florida Water Management District">SFWMD</abbr> and gages to be discontinued by EDEN.
        <ul>
          <li>11 <abbr title="South Florida Water Management District">SFWMD</abbr>-funded gages and 10 EDEN-funded gages are proposed for discontinuing that would not significantly impact the EDEN water-level surfaces</li>
          <li>The EDEN project has secured sufficient funding for <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2013">FY13</abbr> ONLY to maintain 4 additional gages that would otherwise have to be discontinued as a result of funding cuts.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The final list of 6 EDEN-funded gages to be discontinued starting 10/1/12 are:
        <ul>
          <li>3A5</li>
          <li>W14</li>
          <li>W15</li>
          <li>W5</li>
          <li>EDEN1</li>
          <li>TI8</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The <abbr title="South Florida Water Management District">SFWMD</abbr> has coordinated their list of potentially discontinued gages based on the EDEN gage list above. See <a href="#fig1">figure 1</a>.</li>

  </li>
  <li>At the request of the <abbr title="U.S. Army Corps of Engineers">USACE</abbr>, generated and posted <strong>water-level percentile plots for gages and tree islands</strong> in <abbr title="Water Conservation Area 3A">WCA3A</abbr> and 3B, and <abbr title="Everglades National Park">ENP</abbr> to compare water levels under the <abbr title="Everglades Restoration Transition Plan">Everglades Restoration Transition Plan (ERTP)</abbr> with water levels under the <abbr title="Interim Operational Plan">Interim Operational Plan (IOP)</abbr>. The Tribes in the Everglades wanted to ensure that the <abbr title="Everglades Restoration Transition Plan">ERTP</abbr> would not excessively overtop tree islands under the new operational plan for the <abbr title="Central & South Florida">C&amp;SF</abbr> project. The daily water-level percentile plots allow stakeholders to monitor water levels and a daily email alert system informs them when current water levels reach specified elevations at one or more gages or tree islands.

<ul>
  <li><em>Greater Everglades <abbr title="Priority Ecosystems Science">PES</abbr> funds</em> -- The <strong>EDENapps tools</strong> continue to offer EDEN users capabilities such as data viewing, data retrieval, and data access and manipulation. Expansion of the EDEN datasets and increased digital requirements require that the EDENapps tools be upgraded to 64-bit processing on a Java-based platform. To take advantage of the work funded by other <abbr title="Greater Everglades Priority Ecosystems Science">GE PES</abbr> funds, the <abbr title="National Wetlands Research Center">National Wetlands Research Center (NWRC)</abbr> in Lafayette, <abbr title="Louisiana">LA</abbr> is working with EDEN to improve capabilities of the existing tools.

<h3><abbr title="four">IV</abbr>. Administrative (Contractual and Budgetary)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>As a result of significant cuts to the <abbr title="REstoration COordination and VERification">RECOVER</abbr> budget, the EDEN project received a 30% reduction in the original budgeted amount for <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2012">FY12</abbr>. The <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2012">FY12</abbr> funded amount was reduced.</li>
  <li>Several of the recent EDEN products and developments, such as the <abbr title="Automated Data Assurance and Management">ADAM</abbr> software and the new surface-water model, are expected to make handling of the data and generation of water surfaces more efficient. The greatest impact of the budget reduction is the discontinuance of water-level gages in the Everglades.</li>
  <li>Florida Atlantic University (<abbr title="Florida Atlantic University">FAU</abbr>, Dr. Zhixiao Xie) was funded by the EDEN project through a <abbr title="Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Units">CESU</abbr> agreement in <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2012">FY12</abbr> for:
    <ul>
      <li>Testing methods and modeling schemes for sub-domain models for the EDEN study area</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><abbr title="five">V</abbr>. <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2012">FY12</abbr> Deliverables/Reports</h3>
<ul>
  <li>EDENweb has been updated throughout the year to provide data, metadata, and documentation to <abbr title="Monitoring and Assessment Plan">MAP</abbr> <abbr title="Principal Investigators">PIs</abbr> and others.</li>
  <li>Quarterly Reports have been submitted on time to the <abbr title="REstoration COordination and VERification">RECOVER</abbr> <abbr title="Monitoring and Assessment Plan">MAP</abbr> coordinators.</li>
</ul>
<h3><abbr title="six">VI</abbr>. <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2013">FY13</abbr> Workplan</h3>
<p>This plan includes work elements funded from both <abbr title="REstoration COordination and VERification">RECOVER</abbr>
<abbr title="Monitoring and Assessment Plan">MAP</abbr> and <abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey">USGS</abbr> <abbr title="Greater Everglades Priority Ecosystems Science">GE PES</abbr>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Continue to generate and post daily water-level surfaces of the Everglades for users.</li>
  <li>Document all the new work via <abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey">USGS</abbr> series reports and journal articles.</li>
  <li>Revise EDEN data management plan.</li>
  <li>Implement <abbr title="Everglades Restoration Transition Plan">ERTP</abbr> email alert.</li>
  <li>Complete and test subarea models.</li>
  <li>Implement webpage for EDEN oligohaline zone (<a href="../coastal.php">Coastal EDEN</a>).</li>
  <li>Provide hydrologic analyses and results for 2013 System Status Report to Congress.</li>
  <li>Collaborate with National Wetlands Research Center for revisions to several of the EDENapps tools; the EDEN <a href="../edenapps/dataviewer.php">DataViewer</a> and <a href="../edenapps/transectplotter.php">TransectPlotter</a></li>
  <li>Develop EDEN-Syn and have selected <abbr title="Principal Investigators">PIs</abbr> test applications.</li>
  <li>Participate in the 2013 National Conference on Ecosystem Restoration (<abbr title="National Conference on Ecosystem Restoration">NCER</abbr>) and present recent EDEN analyses and results.</li>
  <li>Continue to work with agencies that are monitoring water levels and develop a plan for creating EDEN daily surfaces with fewer surface-water gages as funding cuts reduce the network. </li>
</ul>
<h3><abbr title="seven">VII</abbr>. Anticipated Needs and Issues</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The challenge for the EDEN project, as with all <abbr title="REstoration COordination and VERification">RECOVER</abbr>-funded projects, is to maintain a viable effort despite the significant reduction in funding in 2012 and beyond. Several of the recent products, such as the <abbr title="Automated Data Assurance and Management">ADAM</abbr> software and new surface-water model, are expected to make the handling of the data and creation of water surfaces more efficient. The anticipated reduction in the gage network is likely to have significant impact on the EDEN process, however it our hope that the data estimation programs and quality-assurance tools previously developed will limit loss of confidence in the EDEN water-level surfaces and other EDEN products.</li>
</ul>
<a id="sxn8"></a>
<h3><abbr title="eight">VIII</abbr>. Funding Status</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The EDEN project budget was cut by 30% for <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2012">FY12</abbr> starting 10/1/11.</li>
  <li>As of 9/30/12, all of the <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2012">FY12</abbr> funding under <abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey">USGS</abbr> IA #28 has been expended or obligated. Invoices will be electronically submitted to the <abbr title="U.S. Army Corps of Engineers">USACE</abbr> within the next few months.</li>
  <li><abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey">USGS</abbr> <abbr title="Priority Ecosystems Science">Priority Ecosystem Science (PES)</abbr> funding in <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2012">FY12</abbr> was to multiple principal investigators in support for EDEN research efforts. This level of support is expected to be continued in <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2013">FY13</abbr> with a potential 10-20% cut.</li>
