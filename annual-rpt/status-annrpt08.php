<h3><abbr title="one">I</abbr>. Major Accomplishments</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The EDENweb (<a href="../index.php">sofia.usgs.gov/eden</a>) serves EDEN <a href="../models/watersurfacemod.php">daily water level surfaces</a> for 1/1/00 to current. Based on status of gage data, the surfaces are real-time, provisional, or final.</li>
  <li>The EDENapps tools are posted to the EDENweb:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="../edenapps/dataviewer.php">Data Viewer</a></li>

  <li>Twenty-five water level gages were operated as part of the EDEN network of water level gages.</li>
  <li>EDENapps tools posted to CERPZone; required some recoding, testing and documentation.</li>
  <li>Conducted a statistical analysis of ground elevation data in <abbr title="Water Conservation Area 1">WCA1</abbr> to better understand the highly variable ground elevation in that subarea.</li>
  <li>Conducted a statistical analysis to define variability of ground throughout the EDEN domain and how it related to computation of water depth.</li>
  <li>Funded USGS National Wetlands Research Center, Lafayette, <abbr title="Louisiana">LA</abbr> for support for EDENapps maintenance and enhancements.</li>
  <li>Developed training workshop and materials for use of EDENapps tools and EDEN datasets for PIs and staff, conducted training at <a href="https://archive.usgs.gov/archive/sites/sofia.usgs.gov/geer/2008/">GEER</a> for about 50 users.</li>
  <li><a href="../newsletter.php">EDEN Newsletter </a>currently has 90 subscribers and is used to notify users of updates or additions to the EDEN website.<li>Made modifications and enhancements to the EDEN database and programs that store and manipulate the EDEN data and create the <a href="../models/watersurfacemod.php">EDEN daily surfaces of water level</a>.</li>
  <li>Created a demo Everglades tree island database and web-based map application with rollover stations information, including new information formatting, with new, multi-size, and linked images, animations, and graphs - used at EDEN booth at GEER.</li>
</ul>

  <li><a href="https://archive.usgs.gov/archive/sites/sofia.usgs.gov/geer/2008/">GEER 2008</a>; 5 GEER sessions talks were presented by EDEN staff or staff funded by EDEN.</li>
</ul>
<h3><abbr title="three">III</abbr>. Administrative (Contractual and Budgetary)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The EDEN project continued to fund <abbr title="University of Florida">University of Florida (UF)</abbr> for project support through a CESU agreement in <abbr title="fiscal year">FY</abbr>08 and plans to fund in <abbr title="fiscal year">FY</abbr>09.

</ul>
<h3><abbr title="four">IV</abbr>. SUPPORT FROM OTHER PROGRAMS AND FUNDING SOURCES</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Greater Everglades <abbr title="Priority Ecosystems Science">PES</abbr> funds continue to support the EDEN project by funding efforts by Paul Conrads (<abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey, South Carolina">USGS-SC</abbr>), John Jones (<abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey, Reston">USGS-Reston</abbr>), Heather Henkel (<abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey, Florida Integrated Science Center">USGS-FISC</abbr>), Mike Holmes (<abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey, Florida Integrated Science Center">USGS-FISC</abbr>), and Aaron Higer (<abbr title="University of Florida">UF</abbr>). Additionally, <abbr title="Priority Ecosystems Science">PES</abbr>  provides some funds for Pamela Telis (<abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey, Florida Integrated Science Center">USGS-FISC</abbr>) in her role as project coordinator and liaison with the <abbr title="U.S. Army Corps of Engineers">USACE</abbr>.</li>
  <li>SFWMD has provided funding to survey 5 gages in the EDEN network in <abbr title="Everglades National Park">ENP</abbr> to <abbr title="North American Vertical Datum of 1988">NAVD88</abbr>. Four of the gages are operated by <abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey">USGS</abbr> and one is operated by <abbr title="Everglades National Park">ENP</abbr>. Additionally, Jana Newman investigated the status of surveys of gages in northern <abbr title="Water Conservation Area">WCA</abbr>3A that are operated by <abbr title="South Florida Water Management District">SFWMD</abbr> and will ensure that surveys are used to update the water level data in coming months.</li>

<h3><abbr title="seven">VII</abbr>. UNFUNDED NEEDS IN <abbr title="Fiscal Year 2009">FY09</abbr></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Several activities would greatly enhance the EDEN products and data to <abbr title="principle investigators">PIs</abbr> however are not funded through the EDEN project:
    <ul>
      <li>Provide <abbr title="evapotranspiration">ET</abbr> data by gage location for 1995 to current on the EDENweb. And keep the rainfall data by gage location current based on data compiled from <abbr title="South Florida Water Management District">SFWMD</abbr> monthly.</li>
      <li>Conduct <abbr title="North American Vertical Datum of 1988">NAVD88</abbr> surveys at up to 30 water level gages in EDEN network. The survey would need to have high-level accuracy, probably using differential <abbr title="global positioning system">GPS</abbr>. Perhaps about $3<abbr title="thousand">K</abbr> per gage.</li>
      <li>Purchase radio telemetry equipment for 15 <abbr title="South Florida Water Management District">SFWMD</abbr> water level gages in the EDEN network that currently are non-real-time. These gages were added to the EDEN network because they are in critical locations but without real-time telemetry they are not used for creation of the real-time water level surfaces. Perhaps about $4-5<abbr title="thousand">K</abbr> per gage.</li>
      <li>Make several critical code changes and enhancements to the EDENapps to improve the reliability and usefulness of the EDEN data and products for <abbr title="principle investigators">PIs</abbr>. Perhaps $30-50<abbr title="thousand">K</abbr>.</li>
      <li>Install and survey to <abbr title="North American Vertical Datum of 1988">NAVD88</abbr> a network of benchmarks (approximately 30 to 40) in the Everglades marshes: northern <abbr title="Water Conservation Area">WCA</abbr>3A, <abbr title="Water Conservation Area">WCA</abbr>1, <abbr title="Water Conservation Area">WCA</abbr>2, western <abbr title="Water Conservation Area">WCA</abbr>3B, <abbr title="Everglades National Park">ENP</abbr> and <abbr title="Big Cypress National Preserve">BCNP</abbr>. Cost not known at this time.</li>
      <li>Install and operate shallow (approximately 5-8 feet below ground) ground water wells at approximately 20 water level gages in the EDEN network. Perhaps about $6<abbr title="thousand">K</abbr> per gage for installation, operation costs not known at this time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><abbr title="eight">VIII</abbr>. ANTICIPATED NEEDS OR ISSUES</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The EDEN project agreement with the <abbr title="U.S. Army Corps of Engineers">USACE</abbr> is approved through March 2010. The project chief (Pamela Telis, <abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey">USGS</abbr>) will need to be notified by January-February 2009 of the status of funding and scope of work after March 2010 to allow time for discontinuing, revising, or continuing the project. For example, if funding for the 25 water level gages will discontinue, they must be decommissioned and dismantled or other funding sources must be found.</li>
</ul>
<h3><abbr title="nine">IX</abbr>. FUNDING STATUS</h3>
<ul>
  <li>As of 9/26/08, all <abbr title="fiscal year">FY</abbr>08 funding has been expended or obligated.</li>
  <li>On 9/3/08, the total funding for <abbr title="fiscal year">FY</abbr>09 ($530,263) was accepted by <abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey">USGS</abbr>. These funds were &quot;no-year&quot; funds and the <abbr title="U.S. Geological Survey">USGS</abbr> will hold until 10/1/08 when they will be available to expend or obligate as needed for <abbr title="fiscal year">FY</abbr>09 activities.</li>
