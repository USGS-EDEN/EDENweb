These data have been downloaded from the Everglades Depth Estimation Network (EDEN) database through the Explore and View EDEN (EVE) web application.

EDEN's ADAM software quality assures the measured data, identifies erroneous data, and estimates missing data. Data are identified as 'dry' (see note below for 'data type') based on the measurements of ground elevation in the vicinity of the gage by EDEN staff or on ground elevation data provided by the operating agencies.
The file contains the following information for each gage:Station = EDEN station nameDate = date of data (YYYYMMDD)Daily median water level (feet, NAVD88) = daily median of the hourly water level data at gage for date specified, in feetWater level data type = type of data collected at the gage for specified date; "O" for observed or measured data, "M" for missing data, "E" for estimated data, and "D" for dry conditions at the gage (see detailed description below)Water level quality flag = identifies the level of quality assurance of the data; "F" for final data, "P" for provisional data where data have received some review from the operating agency, and "R" for real-time data that have received little or no review from the operating agency.For Data type: If a single hourly value is measured, a daily median is computed and identified as data type of measured (O). Missing data (M) means that all hourly data for that day is missing for the gage. Estimated data (E) means that all hourly values are estimated at the gage for that day. Conditions at the gage are considered dry (D) if the daily median is equal to or below the average ground elevation at the gage. If the data at a gage is determined to be dry, the data is not identified as measured, estimated, or missing.
--WARNING-------------------------------------------------------------------Water-level data are reviewed periodically to ensure accuracy. All data are considered provisional and subject to revision until it is approved by the operating agency and identified as final. Provisional data must be cited as provisional and subject to change. The data are released on the conditions that neither the USGS nor the United States Government may be held liable for any damages resulting from its use.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rainfall Data-------------------------------------------------------------Rainfall data is based on Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD) data from the U.S. National Weather Service which provides complete spatial coverage of rainfall amounts for the State of Florida. The accuracy of NEXRAD data is enhanced when adjusted using the local rain-gage data. The rainfall data is provided by the South Florida Water Management District and the point of contact is Qinglong (Gary) Wu (qwu@sfwmd.gov). For more information about the rainfall data, go to http://sofia.usgs.gov/eden/nexrad.php.The file contains the following information for each gage:Station = EDEN station nameDate = date of data (YYYYMMDD)Rainfall (inches) = daily total rainfall (in inches) for specified date-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Evapotranspiration Data----------------------------------------------------Evapotranspiration (ET) data is based on a network of 15 data collection sites operated by the USGS throughout Florida. Go to http://fl.water.usgs.gov/et/ for information about Florida's evapotranspiration data resources.The file contains the following information for each gage:Station = EDEN station nameDate = date of data (YYYYMMDD)Evapotranspiration (millimeters) = daily total evapotranspiration (in millimeters) for specified date------------------------------------------------------------------------------Contact: http://sofia.usgs.gov/eden/contacts.php
