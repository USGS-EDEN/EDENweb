<h2>Benchmark Installation Details</h2>
<p>(Updated June 2010)</p>
<p>The benchmarks were established to Class B (stainless steel rod driven to refusal) <abbr title="National Geodetic Survey">NGS (National Geodetic Survey)</abbr> stability standards. They were set in a location that is undisturbed and typical of the surrounding vegetation and topography. If the area appeared to be frequently dry, the benchmark was located nearby in or near a low swale or slough where water may be more often present.</p>
<p>All aspects of the NGS requirements were used including procedures, mark ties, closures, instrumentation, electronic note keeping, online recording, and utilizing NGS-approved processing software for field collection. The expected vertical accuracy of all benchmarks is 2 centimeters. Accuracy standards can be found at: <a href="http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/NGS-58.html">http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/NGS-58.html</a>.</p>
<p>At some locations, two additional reference marks were set to provide redundancy at the site. For example, if the primary benchmark is disturbed, a survey from the reference marks can reestablish the elevation. The two stainless steel reference marks were set to similar NGS standards within 80 feet of the benchmark. A closed level loop was performed, originating at the benchmark, to the two reference marks.</p>
